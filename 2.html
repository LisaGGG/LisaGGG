      <div class="text">
        <p>The <a href name="Universe">universe</a> (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps <a href name="Infinite">infinite</a> number of <a href name="Hexagon">hexagonal</a> galleries, with vast air <a herf name="Shafts">shafts</a> between, surrounded by very low railings. From any of the <a href name="Hexagon1">hexagons</a> one can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, <a href name="Scarcely">scarcely</a> exceeds that of a normal <a href name="Bookcase">bookcase</a>. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another <a href name="Gallery">gallery</a>, <a href name="Identical">identical</a> to the first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not <a href name="Infinite1">infinite</a> (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the <a href name="Infinite2">infinite</a>&hellip; Light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each <a href name="Hexagon2">hexagon</a>. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.</p>

        <p>Like all men of the Library, I have <a href name="Traveled">traveled</a> in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of <a href name="Catalogues">catalogues</a>; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the <a href name="Hexagon3">hexagon</a> in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing; my <a href name="Grave">grave</a> will be the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and <a href name="Decay">decay</a> and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, which is <a href name="Infinite4">infinite</a>. I say that the Library is <a href name="Unending">unending</a>. The idealists argue that the <a href name="Hexagon4">hexagonal</a> rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or <a href name="Pentagonal">pentagonal</a> room is inconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose <a href name="Spine">spine</a> is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic <a herf name="Dictum">dictum</a>: The Library is a <a href name="Sphere">sphere</a> whose exact center is any one of its <a href name="Hexagon5">hexagons</a> and whose circumference is inaccessible.</p>

        <p>There are five shelves for each of the <a href name="Hexagon6">hexagon&apos;s</a> walls; each shelf contains thirty-five books of <a href name="Uniform">uniform</a> format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty <a href name="Letter">letters</a> which are black in color. There are also <a href name="Letter1">letters</a> on the <a href name="Spine1">spine</a> of each book; these <a href name="Letter2">letters</a> do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its <a href name="Tragic">tragic</a> projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few <a href name="Axioms">axioms</a>.</p>

        <p>First: The Library exists <a href name="Ab_Aeterno">ab aeterno</a>. This truth, whose immediate corollary is the future <a href name="Eternal1">eternity</a> of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind. Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi; the <a href name="Universe1">universe</a>, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical <a href name="Volume">volumes</a>, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can only be the work of a <a href name="God">god</a>. To perceive the distance between the <a href name="Divine">divine</a> and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic <a href name="Letter3">letters</a> inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.</p>

        <p>Second: The <a href name="Orthographical">orthographical</a> symbols are twenty-five in number. This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library and solve <a href name="Satisfactorily">satisfactorily</a> the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the <a href name="Formless">formless</a> and chaotic nature of almost all the books. One which my father saw in a <a href name="Hexagon7">hexagon</a> on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the <a href name="Letter4">letters</a> <a href name="Mcv">MCV</a>, perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of <a href name="Letter5">letters</a>, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless <a href name="Cacophonies">cacophonies</a>, verbal jumbles and incoherences. (I know of an <a href name="Uncouth">uncouth</a> region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one&apos;s palm&hellip; They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books <a herf name="Signify">signify</a> nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)</p>

        <p>For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote <a href name="Language">languages</a>. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a <a href name="Language1">language</a> quite different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is <a href name="Incomprehensible">incomprehensible</a>. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable <a href name="Mcv1">MCV&apos;s</a> cannot correspond to any <a href name="Language2">language</a>, no matter how dialectical or <a href name="Rudimentary">rudimentary</a> it may be. Some insinuated that each <a href name="Letter6">letter</a> could influence the following one and that the value of <a href name="Mcv2">MCV </a>in the third line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought of <a href name="Cryptographs">cryptographs</a>; generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was formulated by its originators.</p>

        <p>Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper <a href name="Hexagon8">hexagon</a> came upon a book as confusing as the others, but which had nearly two pages of <a href name="Homogeneous">homogeneous</a> lines. He showed his find to a wandering <a href name="Decoder">decoder</a> who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the <a href name="Language3">language</a> was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how <a href name="Diverse">diverse</a> they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two <a href name="Identical1">identical</a> books. From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not <a href name="Infinite5">infinite</a>): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the <a herf name="Commentary">commentary</a> on that gospel, the <a href name="Commentary1">commentary</a> on the <a href name="Commentary2">commentary</a> on that gospel, the true story of your <a href name="Death">death</a>, the translation of every book in all <a href name="Language4">languages</a>, the interpolations of every book in all books.</p>

        <p>When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The <a href name="Universe2">universe</a> was justified, the <a href name="Universe3">universe</a> suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal was said about the <a href name="Vindication">Vindications</a>: books of apology and prophecy which <a href name="Vindication1">vindicated</a> for all time the acts of every man in the <a href name="Universe4">universe</a> and retained prodigious <a href name="Arcana">arcana</a> for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their <a href name="Vindication2"Vindication</a>. These <a href name="Pilgrims">pilgrims</a> disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways, flung the deceptive books into the air <a herf name="Shafts">shafts</a>, met their <a href name="Death1">death</a> cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad&hellip; The <a href name="Vindication3">Vindications</a> exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that the possibility of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be computed as zero.</p>

        <p>At that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity&apos;s basic mysteries - the origin of the Library and of time - might be found. It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries could be explained in words: if the <a href name="Language5">language</a> of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have produced the unprecedented <a href name="Language6">language</a> required, with its vocabularies and grammars. For four centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons&hellip; There are official searchers, inquisitors. I have seen them in the performance of their function: they always arrive extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a <a href name="Broken">broken</a> stairway which almost killed them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words. Obviously, no one expects to discover anything.</p>

        <p>As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive <a href name="Depression">depression</a>. The <a href name="Certitude">certitude</a> that some shelf in some hexagon held <a href name="Precious">precious</a> books and that these <a href name="Precious1">precious</a> books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A blasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should <a href name="Juggle">juggle</a> letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books. The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared, but in my <a href name="Childhood">childhood</a> I have seen old men who, for long periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a <a href="Forbidden">forbidden</a> dice cup and feebly mimic the divine <a href="Disorder">disorder</a>.</p>

        <p>Others, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed through a volume with <a href name="Displeasure">displeasure</a> and condemned whole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the <a href name="Senseless">senseless</a> perdition of millions of books. Their name is execrated, but those who deplore the <a href name="Treasures">&quot;treasures&quot;</a> destroyed by this frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every copy is <a href name="Unique">unique</a>, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a <a href name="Letter7">letter</a> or a comma. Counter to general <a href name="Opinion">opinion</a>, I venture to suppose that the <a href name="Consequences">consequences</a> of the Purifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics produced. They were urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, <a href name="Powerful">all-powerful</a>, illustrated and <a href name="Magical">magical</a>.</p>

        <p>We also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the formula and perfect <a href name="Compendium">compendium</a> of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is <a href name="Analogous">analogous</a> to a <a href name="God1">god</a>. In the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionary's cult still persist. Many wandered in search of Him. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed him? Someone proposed a <a href name="Regressive">regressive</a> method: To locate book A, consult first book B which indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinity&hellip; In <a href name="Adventures">adventures</a> such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the <a href name="Universe5">universe</a>; I pray to the unknown <a href name="God2">gods</a> that a man - just one, even though it were thousands of years ago! - may have examined and read it. If honor and <a href name="Wisdom">wisdom</a> and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let <a href name="Heaven">heaven</a> exist, though my place be in <a href name="Hell">hell</a>. Let me be <a href name="Outraged">outraged</a> and annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justified. The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble and pure coherence) is an almost <a href name="Miraculous">miraculous</a> exception. They speak (I know) of the "feverish Library whose chance volumes are constantly in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity." These words, which not only denounce the <a href name="Disorder1">disorder</a> but exemplify it as well, notoriously prove their authors' abominable taste and desperate <a href name="Ignorance">ignorance</a>. In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the twenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlo. These phrases, at first glance <a href name="Incoherent">incoherent</a>, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner; such a <a href name="Justification">justification</a> is verbal and, ex hypothesi, already figures in the Library. I cannot combine some characters

        which the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret <a href name="Tongue">tongues</a> do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with <a href name="Tenderness">tenderness</a> and <a href name="Fear">fear</a>, which is not, in one of these <a href name="Language6">languages</a>, the <a herf name="Powerful1">powerful</a> name of a <a href name="God3">god</a>. To speak is to fall into tautology. This wordy and useless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumerable hexagons - and its refutation as well. (An n number of possible <a href name="Language7">languages</a> use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol library allows the correct definition a <a href name="Ubiquitous">ubiquitous</a> and lasting system of hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven words which define it have another value. You who read me, are You sure of understanding my <a href name="Language8">language</a>?)</p>

        <p>The methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men. The certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms. I know of districts in which the young men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pages in a <a href name="Barbarous">barbarous</a> manner, but they do not know how to decipher a single <a href name="Letter8">letter</a>. Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations which inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the population. I believe I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years. Perhaps my old age and <a href name="Fear1">fearfulness</a> deceive me, but I suspect that the human species - the <a hre name="Unique1">unique</a> species - is about to be extinguished, but the Library will endure: <a href name="Illuminated">illuminated</a>, solitary, <a href name="Infinite6">infinite</a>, perfectly motionless, equipped with <a herf name="Precious2">precious</a> volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.</p>

        <p>I have just written the word "<a href name="Infinite7">infinite</a>".' I have not interpolated this adjective out of rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is <a href name="Infinite8">infinite</a>. Those who <a href name="Judge">judge</a> it to be <a href name="Limit">limited</a> postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceivably come to an end - which is absurd. Those who imagine it to be without <a href name="Limit1">limit</a> forget that the possible number of books does have such a <a href name="Limit2">limit</a>. I venture to suggest this solution to the <a href name="Ancient">ancient</a> problem: The Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an <a href name="Eternal">eternal</a> traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in the same <a href name="Disorder2">disorder</a> (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). My solitude is gladdened by this elegant <a href name="Hope">hope</a>.
